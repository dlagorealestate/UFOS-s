## Overview

  * Dana wanted a more in depth analysis on the UFO sightings. So we added a way to be able to filter by coulumn, search date and country to be able to see exactly what sightings happened. 



## Summary

 * One drawback from the data was there is no "from" function so that we can have multiple time frames and view multiple sightings at once in a specified time.
 * That would also be my recommendation is to add a filter for from so we can see multiple dates
